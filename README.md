Tatris
=============
A "falling blocks game" written in Processing.  Some notable features:

* True random pieces - you'll never get 3 "line pieces" in a row.  Or any other piece for that matter.
* Sound effects - disable option
* Offscreen rendering for effects when pausing etc
* Increasing difficulty, although it's not very hard to play for a long time

Default controls:

* Left Arrow = Left
* Right Arrow = Right
* Up Arrow = Rotate
* Down Arrow = Down one line
* Space = Drop piece
* ESC = Menu / Pause

TODO:

* Occasional and hard to replicate Piece dropping bug, need to rework entire grid design
